# AI-RaceCars
This is my submission to Debuggit 2k23. This is an AI model to train cars. As an applications, it can be used in car racing games as opponent AI. The difficulty of the AI can be adjusted by training the model to a specific level of proficiency. The cars use ANN for movement and are trained by genetic algorithms

The engine used is the Unity Game Engine. The purpose of the engine is only for 3D rendering. All the code for the neural networks and implementation of genetic algorithms is done in C#.

I might later extend this to make a fully fledged racing game where the AI is trained by this method.

To run the game, click on the Self Driving Car.exe file. Make sure there are to .dll errors.


Important Controls And Instructions: 1) 'P' is to progress a generation ( Each car's NN is updated)
                                     2) 'Space' resets the cars to start
                                     
When satisfied with the current generation, Press 'P' and then quickly later press 'Space' to reset the cars and let them traverse the track again
